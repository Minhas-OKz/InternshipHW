  <h1> <a name="Choosing Formatting Options"> Choosing Formatting Options </a> </h1> <br>
 <p> As you begin to design a document, you will need to consider the basic layout, margins, line spacing, and alignment on the page. 
 If none of these options matter to you,
 you can simply accept the default choices of the software you are using. For most documents, however, you will likely
 want to make some changes from the default settings.. <br>

 <h1> <a name= "Basic Layout"> Basic Layout </a> </h1>
 <p> You will need to decide the best basic layout for your document. For example, if you are writing a novel, you will likely want to use
 straight text in paragraphs. But if you are creating a comparison of three novelistsâ€™ treatments of the same topic, you might want to
 use columns or a chart..

  <h1> <a name="White Space" > White Space  </a> </h1>
<p> White space is the area on a page (hard-copy or digital) that is not covered with text or images. Keep in mind that well-used white space
  makes a page more visually appealing and easier to read. White space, of course, is not always white; on a blue sheet of paper, or against
  a blue backdrop on a web page, white space is blue. Regardless of color, a balance of white space and text makes a page easier and more inviting to read.
 When you are free to make your white-space choices, </p>

 <h1> <a name = "Margins"> Margins </a> </h1>
<p> You can also set margins and line spacing to manage the amount of white space in a document. In some situations, 
 such as a specific academic research or professional setting, you are likely to encounter specific guidelines regarding margin widths and 
 line spacing. In many situations, </p>

 <h1> <a name= "Alignment on Page">  Alignment on Page </a></h1>
<p> Alignment choices can also affect the overall look of a page of text. With most word processing software, 
 you can choose to align text to the left, to the right, or to the center. You can also justify text, which is sort of a combination of the 
 other three options:
